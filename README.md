
# Todo App
A simple app that lets a user create, edit and delete notes with a slightly sandbox interface  

## Getting Started
Download the project files from github onto your local machine.

### Prerequisites
The only prerequisite for running the todo app is that you have access to a local host server in order to access the database.  The database must also be set up in a specific way
```
You can use any of the follwoing free programs to set up a local host:
Xampp
Wamp
Mamp
```
### Installing
Please follow the install instruction for Wamp/Mamp/Xampp from the providers as well as the local host setup.

## Deployment
To deploy the todo website:
Once you have your local host server setup, move the downloaded project files into your designated local host folder on your computer. Access your local host in your selected web browser. 
Make sure you create your local Database according to the given blueprint

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* PHP
* Jquery
* JavaScript 
* MySQL 
* Ajax

## Description
A user is asked to register himself and provide a profile picture if he wants one.  An email then gets send to that user with a link included. Once the user clicks on the link his account will then be verified and he will have access to login and go to the TODO app

In the todo app the user can quickly create a new note (title, description, dueDate and color of the note). 
The user may choose to edit one of his notes or delete the notes that he doesn't need anymore. 

In addition to that; all of the notes are draggable within a certain section, allowing the user to drag the more important notes to one side or stack the notes as the user sees fit

Everything inside the todo page happens with AJAX.

This project is a showcase of my newly learned skill in AJAX and MySQL.
